# Periodic_Table
A simple project to make an interactive periodic table using HTML, CSS and JavaScript.

We start by simply adding all the elements to make a similar shape as of periodic table on our web page.

Then comes the CSS part with applying a color scheme to all elements. (example : green for Metals, yellow for noble gases etc...).

Finally comes the JavaScript to add animations like pop-ups to provide a detailed insight about elemnet which is selected.
